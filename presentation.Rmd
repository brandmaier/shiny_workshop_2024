# Required software

You need to install these software packages in order to follow along with the examples of today:

- **R**: https://cran.r-project.org
- **RStudio**: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- **tidyverse packages**: 

```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggraph"))
```

# What to expect

.pull-left[
- This is a hands-on workshop; you'll get the most out of it if you download the materials and actively participate
- Introductory R coding skills are OK! We have exercises at varying levels of proficiency
- The workshop materials remain open and accessible after the workshop
- Feel free to team up!

# Goals

class: center, inverse

# Structure of a shiny application

Objectives of today:

- Learn about the structure of a shiny application.

- Learn how to create shiny apps from a template.

- Learn how to think in terms of *inputs* and *outputs*.

- Write your own app (using simulated data, real data or _your_ data)

---

# Content

Let's talk about...

- Reactivity
- User-interface design
- Awesome visualizations


---

# ui and server elements

- The `ui` specifies the _visible_ user interface
  - Dynamic elements *inputs* and *outputs*
  - Static elements like headings, text, static images
  - A layout how to arrange these things
   
- The `server` is _invisible_ and is responsible for all computations
  - The `server` monitors reactive *inputs*
  - When inputs change, *outputs* are updated
  
---

# Reactivity

The simplest structure of a reactive program involves just a source and an endpoint:

# More reactivity

# Outputs and Renderers

Example outputs:

- `textOutput()`

- `plotOutput()`

- `tableOutput()`

You can use

```{r, echo = TRUE}
help.search("Output", package = "shiny")
```

to find other output functions in shiny.

---

# Outputs and Renderers

Each `*Output()` function has a corresponding `render*()` function. For example:

- `textOutput()` $\rightarrow$ `renderText()`
- `plotOutput()` $\rightarrow$ `renderPlot()`
- `tableOutput()` $\rightarrow$ `renderTable()`
---

# Accessing inputs

- Inputs are accessed in the *server* function via the *input* argument.

- Inputs are *reactive*, meaning that changes trigger updates.
---
# Anatomy

```{}
ui <- fluidPage(
    
    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
    
    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
*            sliderInput("bins", ...
        ),
        
        
        mainPanel(
*           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
```

# Demonstration

Code example: XXX (TODO: Leonie, Andreas?)
---
# Challenges

---

# Challenge 1

Goal: XXX (TODO: Leonie?!)

---
# Challenge 2

Starting point: challenges/02-graph/app.Rmd

About the App:
- This app displays a social network graph

Overall Goals:
- Add functionality to change the visualization

Specific Goals:
- Nodes should be colorable by gender (nodes are persons)
- More than two graph layouts should be displayable

# Advanced Topics

## Shiny themes

Shiny uses bootstrap ( https://getbootstrap.com/ ) to display web content

To use other bootstrap themes, install the `shinythemes` package and use the `theme` argument to your page layout function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("shinythemes")
```
